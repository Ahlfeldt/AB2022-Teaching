The economics of skyscrapers: A synthesis

Toolkit

(c) Gabriel M. Ahlfeldt

Version 0.91, 2024-01

General instructions:

This teaching directory complements the article by Ahlfeldt & Barr (2022), published in the Journal of Urban Economics. The toolkit contains a subset of codes used to generate the results in the article. Detailed comments have been added to scripts to provide intuition and links to the model described in the article. All programmes have been written using Stata 18. However, the code should also run on earlier version. Programmes do not use user-written ado files.

Stata data files:

| Name | Description |
|:---------------------------------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| DATA\EMPIRICAL\CH_skyline.dta | Stata file containing land values and heights for Chicago measured along a line (y-coordinate) |
| DATA\SIMULATION\BASE.dta | Synthetic data set generated by _2_ANALYSIS.do |
| DATA\SIMULATION\INVERTED.dta	| Synthetic data set rationalizing Chicago height gradient generated by _3_ INVERSION.do |

Stata do files:

Name  | Description |
|:---------------------------------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|_0_META.do	| Meta do file that calls other code files to execute the analysis. Your journey through the teaching directory starts here!|
|_1_PROGS.do	| Do file that defines programmes used to solve the model and generates a synthetic data set for simulation.|
|_2_ANALYSIS.do| Do file that calls programmes solving the model and illustrating the spatial structure.|
|_3_INVERSION.do |Do file that inverts production and residential amenities to match the fuzzy height gradient of Chicago |
|_4_INVERTEDCOUNTER.do | Do file that conducts a counterfactual analysis conditional on fundamental amenities recovered by _3_INVERSION.do |

Folders

Version 0.91, 2024-01

General instructions:

This teaching directory complements the article by Ahlfeldt & Barr (2022), published in the Journal of Urban Economics. The toolkit contains a subset of codes used to generate the results in the article. Detailed comments have been added to scripts to provide intuition and links to the model described in the article. All programmes have been written using Stata 18. However, the code should also run on earlier version. Programmes do not use user-written ado files.
